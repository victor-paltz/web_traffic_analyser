# Web traffic analyser

## Description

The goal of this project is to monitor HTTP traffic on a machine.

There are several parts in the project:
- A generator of logs that reads a csv file and fills a buffer with requests, following the csv file history.
- A console program that reads incoming logs and do some statistics:
    - Computing the average traffic on a sliding window of 2 minutes and raising alerts if it exceeds a threashold.
    - Computing statistics on the requests every 10 seconds

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies.
There is only one dependency which is "pytest", we could have chosen unittest to remain independant from third-party libraries.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, you should first download the sample_csv.txt file and store it on you machine (ex: "data/sample_csv.txt").
Once it is done, just launch the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py --src_path "data/sample_csv.txt" --avg_trafic_threshold 10 
```
You can use the flag -h for help.

Once it's done, just press any key to start the monitoring app.

## Test

In order to run the test, run the following command:
```bash
pytest 
```
The test are a bit long because the sliding window that we use to compute the average traffic is of 2 minutes.

## Future improvements

There are still many improvement that could be done for this project:
- Coding more tests for the monitoring app
- Improving the design of the app (using colors)
- Handling more edge case in the program (checking that the inputs are in the good format)
- Creating more general classes for the objects in order to reuse the code
- Controling the simulation time speed in order to run faster tests
- Drawing a traffic curve in real time and a threshold line
- Modifying the code to make each thread less inter-dependant
- ...
